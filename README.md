# Secret Auction

This is my coding challenge submission for day #9 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training. Secret Auction is an application for holding a bidding process in which the highest bidder wins a prize.

## Description

This project is a command-line based application that takes in information from a user to capture bidding information and upon finishing, determines the highest bidder in the process and declares the winner. The application will also present the bid amount of the winner. 

## Requirements

In order to run the application, the following items must be installed:
- `python`  v3.6 or higher
- `art` package

## Installation

To install the project-name application, the following steps must be taken: 

- Clone or download the repository.
- Navigate to the repository's directory in the terminal.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start the application with `python main.py`.

## Usage

To start a bidding process, run `python main.py`

The application will then prompt for a name and bid amount for each user who is participating in the bidding process. 

Once all bidding is complete, the application will declare the winner and present their bid amount.
