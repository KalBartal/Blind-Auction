# Secret Auction

This is my coding challenge submission for day #9 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This application provides a secret auction platform where an unlimited number of bidders can place their maximum bid without knowing the the previous bids placed by other bidders. If there are no more bidders, the auction reveals the winner and their maximum bid.

## Usage

```
What is your name?:

What is your bid?:

Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes or 'no'.

The winner is {winner} with a bid of ${highest_bid}.

```
